# GifTastic
In this assignment, I will be utilizing jQuery to populate my web app and call the GIPHY API to display the results on the webpage. The user can add a keyword from my array list to display the still images and/or animations. User will be able to click on a particular image to view animation. Clicking on the same image for the second time will stop the animation. Enjoy my giftastic page!
